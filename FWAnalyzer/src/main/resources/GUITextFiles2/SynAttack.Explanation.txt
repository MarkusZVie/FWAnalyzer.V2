201003 - This is a connection-related message regarding traffic to the security appliance. This message is displayed when the number of embryonic connections from the specified foreign address with the specified static global address to the specified local address exceeds the embryonic limit. This message indicates a more serious overload than message 201002. It could be caused by a SYN attack, or by a very heavy load of legitimate traffic.
